 <InitialSituation>

The merchant lived in one city with kupčihoû, and gave them the Lord sons

precocious smyšlenogo, on behalf of Basil. </InitialSituation>

 < DeceitByVillain subtype = "Other" >

 Just as they had lunch together; and over 

stolim hung in a cage so piteously, and Nightingale sang,
the merchant is not suffered and said:
«If syskalsâ any person who guesses would I really,
that Nightingale sang, and what an fate portends,

It would seem life would give him half of the estate, 
and upon the death of rejected lots of goodness. 
" As a boy he was six years old then looked to his father and mother in
the eye ozojlivo and said: "I know that the Nightingale Sings, so to say 
I'm afraid. "Speak without holding back!" stuck to his father and mother,
and Joe with tears saying: "Nightingale heralds, there will come a
time-the time will you serve me: father will become water Lodge, and 
his mother polotece face, hands utirat′." </DeceitByVillain>

 These words hurt grieved the Merchant with kupčihoû, and they decided

He saw the boy's kopabel′ŝik, feel sorry for him, took him to, asked about all 
and promised to hold and love him as a native son. The other day said boy new to
the father: "Solovejde hums, podymetsâ storm, polomaet masts, will pass through 
the sails; We must povprodvorotit′ in labor. "

 

 But korabel′ŝik is not obeyed. 

 

Indeed, the storm has broken up the mast, the sails are cut short. 

 

Nothing to do, the past cannot be found; put new masts, sails trimmed and sailed on. 

 

And Joe again says: 

 

"Solovejde hums that meet are twelve ships, plundering everything in full we will!"

 

 At that time the korabel′ŝik obeyed, privorotil to the island and saw the twelve
 ships, plundering, ran by.

 

How much ought sopyl korabel′ŝik waited on. Neither little nor much time elapsed,
badgering the ship to the city of Hvalynsku;

and said to the King: "your Majesty, you can see that fly here three: Raven, his wife voroniha and 
son of their collars of nenok; Crow with voronihoû argue, who is the son of the father or mother,

Only the King uttered the word Raven with the voronenkom flew to the right and voroniha left. </Victory>

<!-This last sequence of functions presents 

itself as a violation of the predicted Proppian stucture.

 However, upon further analysis, this case is merely

 (a) transformation of the order of what is expected: 

instead of return-recognition-wedding, we have

 wedding-return-recognition. In any case, 

everything works out all right in the end of this 

story. The betrothed hero, recognized as such, 

returns home ... ->

                  

< Wedding subtype = "WeddingThrone" >

by a parent; and then took them with him in the town of khvalynsk, and they all live 
together happily ever after-da goodness making </RecognitionOfHero>.
